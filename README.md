# CodeCampProjects

  I began working with an excellent code camp in June, 2016.  This camp is what initially re-sparked my interest in development, offering me the opportunity to work with non-profit organizations.
  
  Before I had even realized how to work GitHub, I dove into learning.  From time to time, I will post some of my projects here, particularly those pertaining to alogrithm scripting.
  
  As I continue to learn and grow as a developer, these posts will likely evolve.
